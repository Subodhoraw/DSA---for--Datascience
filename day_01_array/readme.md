### array 
find a logic where a list [1,1,2,3,5,6,77,88,88,9,3,4,6] where we will check i is indicators and j is pointer , i will move when j will tell, i that found a new number so we can emove ahead.

so for the first list the new removed duplicatte list is (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8)
lets look at the new list[1000,1000,10001,2000,5000,7000,800,10]
for above  updated list lenth will be (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7)
 lets  look for the differ list = [23,23,45,50,50,60,66,80]
so the length of the list is = (0,1,2,3,4,5)
